Shortcuts for wasm

| wasm-hl       | wasm                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `(0 = 1)`     | `(set_local 0 (f64.const 0))`             |
| `(%$a + %$b)` | `(f64.add (get_local $a) (get_local $b))` |

* Adds infix operators: `*`, +, -, / (all compile to f64 right now)
* Supports (0 = 1) shortcut for `set_local`
* Supports bare numbers that become f64.const
